(Experi)mental web stuff with BASIC and assembler. 

It uses https://github.com/skaliant/uk-wax as a web framework and https://github.com/EgonOlsen71/basicv2 for implementing the
template engine.

It's a reminder of how different web development would be in a world where Commodore has survived, PHP never happened and where we write
our templates in BASIC V2 and 6502 assembler... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21LGv8Cf0us


Usage examples:

http://localhost:8080/[your context path]/cbm/beer/asm for the assembler version 

and

http://localhost:8080/[your context path]/cbm/beer/basic for the BASIC version

You can add an additional parameter ?max=[0..99] to set the maximum number of bottles of beer.
